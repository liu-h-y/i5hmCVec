# exp_on_weakRMdata

We performed the i5hmCVec on the dataset from WeakRM. 

- ```'weakRM_data'``` contains the data and feature file used in this file.

- ```'ger_feature.py'``` is used to generated the feature proposed in i5hmCvec on the dataset from WeakRM.
- ```'train_model.py'``` is used to evaluted the performance of i5hmCvec with different c, gamma in SVM. This Script is used as a parameter tuning Script.
- ```'test_model.py'``` is used to evaluated the performance of i5hmC on the test dataset of WeakRM.
- ```'res'``` is stored as a results of ```'train_model.py'```.
